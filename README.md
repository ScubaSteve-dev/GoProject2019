# GoProject2019
"GoProject2019" was part of a group project for the Software Engineering at Lamar University. Group consist of 7 members,
with BeyJohn and Myself taking up leadership positions. I am responsible for the Capturing, enforcment of Kho Rule (no repeating board states), and Scoring mechanics of the Program.
Capturing and Scoring are implemented with original Flood Fill algorithms.

Scoring: 
Scoring is different than a standard game of go.
Space surrounded by a player is only counted if there is not an opposing player's piece within it.
****But***** 
Each player's pieces on the board are counted towards their score. Becasue of this, you may capture the piece an opposing player places in your territory without "losing" territory.
In this way the game evens out. It would be a waste of the opposing players time to place pieces
in your terrritory because they would inevitably be captured and award more points.
Captured pieces do award points.

Kho rule: 
Kho rule is enforced, board states can't be repeated
